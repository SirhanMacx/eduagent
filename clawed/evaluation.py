"""Voice consistency evaluation framework for Claw-ED.

Evaluates whether generated lessons match the teacher's persona voice.
This is the "5 real teachers, 10 lessons each" test harness — it lets
anyone verify whether the persona extraction and voice injection work.

Usage:
    from clawed.evaluation import evaluate_voice_consistency

    report = await evaluate_voice_consistency(persona, lessons)
    print(report.summary())

CLI:
    clawed evaluate --lessons 10

_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """You are evaluating whether a generated lesson plan matches a teacher's voice and style.

## Teacher Persona
{persona}

## Generated Lesson
Title: {lesson_title}
Objective: {objective}

Do-Now:
{do_now}

Direct Instruction:
{direct_instruction}

Guided Practice:
{guided_practice}

## Evaluation Criteria

Score each dimension from 1-5:

1. **Voice Consistency** (1-5): Does the lesson sound like this teacher wrote it?
   - 5 = Perfect match, indistinguishable from teacher's own writing
   - 3 = Generally similar but some generic/AI-sounding passages
   - 1 = Completely different voice, clearly AI-generated

2. **Vocabulary Match** (1-5): Does the lesson use the teacher's characteristic vocabulary?
   - 5 = Uses teacher's exact phrases, terminology, and word choices
   - 3 = Some matching vocabulary but also many generic terms
   - 1 = Academic/formal language that doesn't match the teacher at all

3. **Structure Match** (1-5): Does the lesson follow the teacher's preferred format?
   - 5 = Matches their exact structural preferences (e.g., warm-ups, exit tickets, etc.)
   - 3 = Has some preferred elements but misses others
   - 1 = Completely different structure

For each score below 4, provide a specific example of where the voice drifted.

## Output Format
Respond with ONLY a JSON object:

{{
    "voice_consistency": 4,
    "vocabulary_match": 3,
    "structure_match": 5,
    "drift_examples": ["The phrase 'leverage synergies' is not how this teacher talks"],
    "notes": "Generally good but the direct instruction section sounds too formal"
