        "     — No standing in lines, no waiting turns, everyone moves at once\n"
        "  2. Skill instruction: Brief demo + cues (KISS: Keep It Short and Simple)\n"
        "     — Use the TGMD (Test of Gross Motor Development) skill cues\n"
        "  3. Practice/Application: Modified games, partner tasks, stations (15-20 min)\n"
        "     — Progressive: individual -> partner -> small group -> game\n"
        "  4. Game/Activity: Full application in game-like context (10-15 min)\n"
        "     — Use the Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) approach\n"

        "  - Maximum participation: Modify rules so no one sits out\n"
