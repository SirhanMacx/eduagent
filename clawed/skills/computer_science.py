        "  2. Modify: Students make targeted changes to existing code (scaffolded)\n"
        "  3. Create: Students design and build original projects from scratch\n\n"

        "  - Predict: What will this code do? (before running)\n"
        "  - Run: Execute and compare to prediction\n"
        "  - Investigate: Trace through code, identify patterns\n"

        "  - Make: Write original code using the same concepts\n\n"
        "Design lessons that:\n"
        "  - Start with unplugged activities to build conceptual understanding\n"
        "  - Use pair programming (driver/navigator roles) to build collaboration\n"
        "  - Include CS Unplugged activities for abstract concepts (sorting, binary, encryption)\n"

        "  - Read the error message carefully\n"
        "  - Reproduce the bug with a minimal test case\n"
        "  - Use print statements / debugger to trace state\n"
        "  - Rubber duck debugging: explain the code line by line\n"
        "  - Compare to a working example\n\n"
