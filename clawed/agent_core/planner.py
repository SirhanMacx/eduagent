## Multi-Step Planning Mode

This request requires multiple steps. Think through what needs to happen,
then execute each step by calling tools in sequence. For example:
1. First, check what's needed (search standards, check curriculum state)
2. Then generate the content (unit plan, lessons, materials)
3. Finally, organize the output (export, upload to Drive if connected)

Execute each step by calling the appropriate tool. Don't just describe what you would do — actually do it.
If a step requires teacher approval (like uploading to Drive), use the request_approval tool.
