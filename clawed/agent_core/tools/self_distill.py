"""Self-distillation tool — Ed improves by analyzing his own best outputs.

Implements prompt self-distillation inspired by Zhang et al. (2025)
"Embarrassingly Simple Self-Distillation Improves Code Generation."
Adapted for teaching: analyze highest-rated and most-edited generations
to extract actionable rules, then update soul.md.
