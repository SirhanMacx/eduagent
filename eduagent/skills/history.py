        "1. Sourcing: Before reading a document, ask:\n"
        "   - Who wrote this? When? Why?\n"
        "   - What is their perspective or bias?\n"
        "   - Is this a reliable source for this question?\n\n"
        "2. Contextualization: Place events/sources in historical context:\n"
        "   - What else was happening at this time and place?\n"
        "   - How does the broader context shape this event/source?\n\n"
        "3. Corroboration: Compare multiple sources:\n"
        "   - Do these sources agree or disagree?\n"
        "   - Where do accounts conflict, and why?\n"
        "   - What might be missing from the historical record?\n\n"
        "4. Close Reading: Read for subtext and argument:\n"
        "   - What is the author's central argument?\n"
        "   - What language choices reveal the author's perspective?\n\n"
        "Use the Causation-Continuity-Change framework for analysis:\n"
        "   - Causation: What caused this event? (short-term triggers vs. long-term factors)\n"
        "   - Continuity: What stayed the same across this period?\n"
        "   - Change: What transformed, and for whom?\n"
        "   - Periodization: Why do historians mark this as a turning point?\n\n"
        "Structure debates and discussions around historical questions, not statements. "
        "Use 'To what extent...?' and 'How significant was...?' question stems."
