## What it does

You point it at a folder of your old lessons. It reads them, figures out how you teach, and generates new ones that match your style. Teacher DOCX, student DOCX, slides PPTX — all at once.

  🍎 Hey Mr. Maccarello! What are we working on today?

❯ Make me a lesson on the causes of the French Revolution for 10th grade

  Searching your materials...
  Found 3 docs on this topic.
  Generating lesson package...

It also runs as a Telegram bot. Same brain, same files, same memory. Ask it to make something from your phone and the files show up in chat.

## How the voice learning works

It reads your files and extracts patterns:
- Lesson structure (I Do / We Do / You Do, stations, seminars)
- Assessment format (CRQ, DBQ, exit ticket style, Do Now format)
- Writing frameworks (TEA, RACE, CER)
- Scaffolding (sentence starters, graphic organizers, word banks)
- Source preferences, grouping strategies, classroom personality

Stored in `~/.eduagent/workspace/soul.md`. You can read it, edit it, or let it evolve.

## Setup

```bash
pip install clawed
clawed
```

It walks you through picking a provider and an API key.

**Recommended:** [Ollama Pro](https://ollama.com/pro) ($20/mo) — unlimited access to good models, easiest setup. For best output quality, use an Anthropic or OpenAI API key (pay per use). OpenRouter lets you pick from any model. Google Gemini has a free tier. Local Ollama runs fully offline for free.

## Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SirhanMacx/Claw-ED.git
cd Claw-ED
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/
```
