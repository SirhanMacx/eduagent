# Roadmap

## Next priorities

- [ ] Visible bot mode — `clawed bot --visible` shows Telegram activity in terminal
- [ ] Image quality — full curriculum ingest with asset registry extraction
- [ ] Onboarding multi-provider — configure 2+ providers during setup
- [ ] Reduce global state coupling (injectable config objects)
- [ ] Narrow exception handling in startup/control-plane code
- [ ] Docker CI smoke test
- [ ] Auth regression tests (401/429 matrix)
- [ ] End-to-end integration test (setup → ingest → generate → export)
