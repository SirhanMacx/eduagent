# Changelog

## v4.5.2026.36 (2026-04-06)

### Model system
- Default model: gemma4:31b-cloud (100% tool-call success, proven in 3-lesson test)
- Interactive /models command on Telegram (inline keyboard: provider → model)
- Model discovery module: dynamic Ollama Cloud + OpenRouter API listing
- Full Ollama Cloud catalog: 24 models with tool-use tags
- OpenRouter free model catalog: 6 curated free models
- OpenRouter tool-use routing fixed (was going to Ollama path, now native)
- OpenRouter timeout increased to 300s for free tier models
- Codex OAuth evaluated and removed (doesn't work for API calls)

### Security + hygiene
- Page auth cookie: ?token= now sets httponly cookie for 24h session
- Onboarding recommends Ollama Pro, mentions /models command
- lru-cache pinned to 10.4.3 (fixes CI TypeScript build)

## v4.5.2026.29 (2026-04-05)

### Hygiene
- Version drift eliminated: CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, pyproject.toml, PyPI all aligned
- Security tests run without localhost bypass — real 401/429 assertions
- Self-equipping gated: install_package requires teacher confirmation, README documents trust model
- README self-equipping claim scoped and explained
- Docker CI fixed (empty CLI bundle stub for hatchling)

## v4.5.2026.28 (2026-04-05)

### Security hardening (audit remediation)
